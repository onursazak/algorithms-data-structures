Why Trees?

1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer

2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).

3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 

4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
