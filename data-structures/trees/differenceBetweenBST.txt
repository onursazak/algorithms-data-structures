Difference Between Binary Search Tree And Binary Tree

    A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.

Binary Tree Data Structure 

    A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. 


Binary Search Tree Data Structure 

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.

    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's keys.
    
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

    There must be no duplicate nodes.
